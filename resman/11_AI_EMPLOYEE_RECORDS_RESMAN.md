# AI "Employee" Records in ResMan Integration

## Overview

The AI "Employee" Records integration creates and manages virtual employee profiles within ResMan's system to enable Elise to function as an authorized agent of record. This integration establishes two AI employee stubs ("Meet Elise" and "House House") with Leasing role permissions, allowing the AI to be properly assigned to guest cards, tours, and tasks while maintaining full audit trails and accountability.

## Key Benefits

- **Proper Attribution**: AI interactions are properly attributed to authorized "employees" in ResMan
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trails for all AI-initiated activities
- **Role-Based Access**: AI employees have appropriate permissions for leasing activities
- **Seamless Integration**: AI appears as legitimate team members in ResMan workflows
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility for AI-generated activities
